        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Erling Braut Haaland is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club
            Manchester City and the Norway national team.
            Known for his exceptional speed, strength, positioning, and clinical finishing, Haaland is widely regarded
            as one of the best strikers in world football.
        </p>

        <p>With his imposing physical presence and predatory instincts in front of goal, Haaland has broken numerous
            records throughout
            his career. His ability to score goals consistently at the highest level has drawn comparisons to some of
            the greatest strikers in football history
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Early Life and Career Start</h2>
        <p>Born in Leeds, England, where his father Alf-Inge Haaland was playing for Leeds United at the time, Erling
            moved to Norway at the age of three. He began his career at his hometown club Bryne FK in 2016, where his
            goalscoring prowess quickly caught the attention of scouts across Europe</p>

        <p>In 2017, at just 16 years old, Haaland joined Molde FK, managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Under Solskjær's
            guidance, he continued to develop his skills and scored regularly in the Norwegian league. His performances
            earned him a move to Red Bull Salzburg in January 2019, where his career would truly take off.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Club Career</h2>
        <p>Haaland's time at Red Bull Salzburg was nothing short of spectacular. He scored 29 goals in 27 appearances,
            including a hat-trick on his Champions League debut against Genk. This remarkable form attracted interest
            from top European clubs, and in December 2019, he signed for Borussia Dortmund.</p>

        <p> At Dortmund, Haaland's reputation as a goalscoring phenomenon was cemented. He scored 86 goals in 89
            appearances across all competitions, becoming one of the most feared strikers in European football. His
            performances in the Champions League were particularly impressive, where he consistently scored against the
            continent's elite teams.</p>

        <p> In the summer of 2022, Manchester City activated his release clause, bringing him to the Premier League. His
            debut season was historic — he broke the Premier League single-season goalscoring record with 36 goals and
            helped City win the treble of Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League. He became the fastest player to
            reach 50 Premier League goals, achieving the feat in just 48 appearances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <p>Haaland made his senior debut for Norway in September 2019 against Malta, where he scored in a 2–0 win. He
            has since become Norway's talisman and captain, leading the team in their quest for qualification to major
            tournaments.</p>

        <p> Despite Norway's absence from recent European Championships and World Cups, Haaland has maintained
            impressive form for his country. He holds several Norwegian national team records and continues to be their
            primary goal threat in international competitions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Style of Play</h2>
        <p>Haaland's playing style is characterized by his exceptional physical attributes combined with technical
            brilliance. Standing at 1.94 meters (6 ft 4 in), he uses his height and strength to dominate defenders,
            while his remarkable speed — he has been clocked at over 36 km/h — makes him a constant threat on the
            counter-attack.</p>

        <p> His positioning is often cited as one of his greatest strengths. Haaland has an innate ability to find space
            in the penalty area, combined with clinical finishing that allows him to score with both feet and his head.
            His movement off the ball and anticipation make him incredibly difficult to mark.</p>

        <p> Football analysts often compare his goal-scoring instinct to legendary strikers like Cristiano Ronaldo and
            Filippo Inzaghi, while his physical dominance draws parallels to players like Zlatan Ibrahimović. What sets
            Haaland apart is the combination of all these attributes at such a young age.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Criticisms and Replies</h2>
        <p>Despite his goalscoring records, Haaland has faced criticism regarding his overall contribution to team play.
            Some pundits have suggested that his playing style is too focused on goalscoring, with less involvement in
            build-up play compared to modern forwards like Harry Kane or Roberto Firmino.</p>

        <p>Haaland and his coaches have responded to such criticism by pointing to his efficiency and the ultimate
            objective of football — scoring goals. Pep Guardiola, his manager at Manchester City, has defended him by
            noting that his movement creates space for teammates and that his presence forces opponents to adjust their
            defensive shape, benefiting the entire team.</p>

        <p> His performances in high-pressure matches, including the Champions League final, have largely silenced
            critics who questioned whether he could perform on the biggest stages. His ability to adapt his game when
            needed has shown his maturity as a player.
