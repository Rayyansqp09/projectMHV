        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Kylian Mbappé Lottin is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Real Madrid
            and the France national team. Widely regarded as one of the best footballers in the world, Mbappé is known
            for his explosive pace, technical brilliance, clinical finishing, and intelligence on the ball.</p>

        <p>Since his breakthrough at a young age, Mbappé has been recognized as a generational talent, capable of
            changing games with moments of individual brilliance. His speed, agility, and tactical awareness make him a
            constant threat to defenders, while his composure in high-pressure situations has earned him a reputation as
            one of the most effective forwards of his generation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Early Life and Career Start</h2>
        <p>Born on December 20, 1998, in Bondy, a suburb of Paris, Kylian Mbappé grew up in a sporting family. His
            father, Wilfried Mbappé, was a football coach, and his mother, Fayza Lamari, a former professional handball
            player. This environment provided Kylian with early exposure to professional sports and a structured
            approach to training from a very young age.</p>

        <p>Mbappé began his youth career at AS Bondy, under his father’s coaching, where his exceptional speed and
            technical skill quickly stood out. In 2013, he joined the Clairefontaine Academy, France’s elite national
            football academy known for producing world-class talent. His performances there attracted interest from
            several top European clubs.</p>

        <p>In 2015, he joined AS Monaco’s youth setup and quickly progressed through the ranks. By 2016, at just 17
            years old, Mbappé made his professional debut for Monaco in Ligue 1, signaling the start of a meteoric rise
            to stardom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Club Career</h2>
        <p>Mbappé’s first professional season with Monaco saw him impress with his pace, dribbling, and eye for goal.
            During the 2016–17 season, he played a key role in Monaco winning the Ligue 1 title, scoring 15 goals in 29
            appearances. His performances in the UEFA Champions League, particularly against Manchester City and
            Borussia Dortmund, highlighted his ability to perform on the biggest stages.</p>

        <p>In 2017, Mbappé moved to Paris Saint-Germain on an initial loan deal, which became permanent in 2018, in a
            transfer reportedly worth €180 million, making him one of the most expensive footballers in history. At PSG,
            he quickly established himself as the club’s main attacking threat alongside Neymar and later Lionel Messi.
        </p>

        <p>He contributed to multiple Ligue 1 titles, domestic cups, and deep runs in the Champions League, including
            reaching the 2020 final, becoming the club's all-time top goalscorer. Mbappé was particularly known for
            scoring in high-pressure matches, including decisive goals in league deciders and European fixtures. His
            consistency in front of goal and ability to create opportunities for teammates made him a central figure in
            PSG’s attacking play throughout his tenure, which concluded after the 2023–24 season.</p>

        <p>In 2024, after years of intense speculation, Mbappé fulfilled a long-held dream by joining Spanish giants
            <strong>Real Madrid</strong> on a free transfer upon the expiration of his contract with Paris
            Saint-Germain. His arrival at the Santiago Bernabéu was heralded as the beginning of a new 'Galáctico' era,
            adding world-class firepower to an already formidable squad.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <p>Mbappé made his senior debut for France in March 2017 at age 18. He quickly became an integral part of the
            national team, showcasing his pace, skill, and composure. The pinnacle of his early international career
            came at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where he played a key role in France’s tournament victory, scoring four
            goals, including one in the final against Croatia. He won the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player award,
            cementing his status as a global superstar.</p>

        <p>Mbappé has since been a regular starter for France in major tournaments, including the UEFA European
            Championship and World Cup qualifiers. He is often praised for his ability to perform under pressure, though
            he has occasionally faced criticism for missed opportunities or lapses in focus during crucial matches.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Style of Play</h2>
        <p>Mbappé is renowned for his explosive speed, dribbling ability, and goal-scoring instincts. Capable of playing
            across the forward line, he is equally effective on the left wing or as a central striker. His acceleration
            allows him to beat defenders in one-on-one situations, while his vision and passing ability make him
            dangerous in combination play.</p>

        <p>Standing at 1.78 meters (5 ft 10 in), Mbappé combines agility with tactical intelligence, often exploiting
            defensive gaps with timing and movement. Analysts frequently compare his pace and finishing ability to
            Thierry Henry, while noting his positional awareness and composure under pressure as distinguishing factors
            in modern football.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-section">
        <h2>Criticisms and Replies</h2>
        <p>Despite his extraordinary talent, Mbappé has faced criticism for aspects of his temperament and
            decision-making. He has occasionally argued with teammates and coaching staff on the pitch, showing
            impatience or frustration when play does not meet his expectations. Some pundits have pointed to his focus
            on individual play over team dynamics in certain matches.</p>

        <p>Mbappé’s public statements about wanting transfers or greater responsibility at PSG have also drawn media
            attention, highlighting tensions between personal ambition and team objectives. However, he consistently
            responds to criticism with performances, often delivering decisive goals and assists in key matches,
            reinforcing his importance to both club and country.</p>
